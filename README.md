# intueri.github.io
A work-in-progress personal repo of the author, meant to demonstrate some of his experience. Some notes:
+ The dataset is not available. The repo currently contains purely executable codes for reference
+ Sections of the codes have been redacted for privacy
+ The codes are part of a data pipeline - as such there will be references to other internal libraries, dataset and database

Currently contains two projects:
+ lapse_feature_generation_msked.py: Feature generation for churn project in life insurance industry. The script is part of a bigger pipeline in which the author contributed - doesn't involve model fitting & not self-contained
+ smart_uw_msked.py: an RFC model for improvement in efficiency & effectiveness of underwriting process. The script is self-contained, output a retrained model upon each run & overall model performance evaluation metrics
